💤 Sleep Quality Prediction

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict sleep quality (Good/Bad) based on various lifestyle and health factors using Logistic Regression. The model is trained on the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset, and it is deployed using Streamlit for an interactive user experience.

🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze the impact of different lifestyle habits (such as physical activity, stress level, and sleep duration) on sleep quality and build a predictive model to classify sleep quality as Good or Bad.
